# e2b CLI (WIP)

Command line interface for [e2b](https://e2b.dev/).

## Installation

```sh
npm install -g @e2b/cli

```

You will need to authenticate to use the e2b CLI.

e2b login
```

To authenticate without the ability to open browser, you can provide E2B_ACCESS_TOKEN as an environment variable.
Obtain your E2B_ACCESS_TOKEN from at [e2b.dev/docs](https://e2b.dev/docs).

```sh
E2B_ACCESS_TOKEN=sk_e2b_... e2b login
```
