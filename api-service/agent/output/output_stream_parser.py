    We receive a stream of tokens and want to parse this stream of tokens to thought and tool logs
    even if we haven't yet received all tokens we need to execute the action.

    We call the self._parse every time we receive new token or tool output.
    This method takes the token buffer and tries to transform it to thought and tool logs.
    It can also create tool logs even if we haven't received all the tokens we need to execute the action yet.

    // Example token buffer content:
    Thought:
    This is a thought

    Action:
    <action type="CurlJavaScriptServer">
    </ac
    // End of example

    This is parsed as following buffered logs:
    [
        {
            "id": "id1",
            "created_at": "2023-03-22 13:46:52.561854",
            "type": "thought",
            "content": "This is a thought",
        },
        {
            "id": "id2",
            "created_at": "2023-03-22 13:46:52.561854",
            "type": "tool",
            "tool_name": "CurlJavaScriptServer,
            "tool_input": "",
        }
    ]

    Buffered logs are thought logs or tool logs for which we haven't received outputs yet.

    We can keep track of the buffered logs because there will always be more tool logs than tool outputs - we must parse the actions from tokens before they executed.
    We are matching the tools' logs and tools' outputs by the order in which they are parsed and ingested (if we need to support asynchronous execution of tools we need to change this matching)
    and the buffered can be flushed to finished logs when we receive output for the last tool in the buffered logs.
