Adds the backend Go SDK for computer-use/desktop

This release introduces a new Go SDK that supports the needed functions to get started with computer use. It has sandbox creation functionalities along with process and filesystem similar to py or js sdk 

This is **additional functionality** and does **not** break any existing APIsâ€”no action is required from consumers.
