# Sandboxes

**Sandbox is a cloud environment for your AI agent or AI app.**
You can create your own sandbox with all the tools you need to run your AI agent or app. You can also use one of our pre-built sandboxes.

Creating a sandbox is as easy as creating docker container. Create Dockerfile and run our CLI tool to build your sandbox.

## Example of Sandbox template
Here's a complete example of our prepared sandbox template for [Data Analysis](https://github.com/e2b-dev/e2b/blob/main/templates/data_analysis/)

## Build your own sandbox

You will need our CLI tool to build your own sandbox.

### CLI tool

The CLI is available as a npm package. You will need node>=18 on your machine.

```bash
npm install -g @e2b/cli
```

We're using Docker to build your sandboxes, create a Dockerfile with all files and dependencies you'll need.

There are few limitations:
- It must be based on Ubuntu {/* TODO: is this true? */}
- Following commands doesn't work: ENTRYPOINT, EXPOSE

{/* TODO: Anything else? */}

### Build
If you have your Dockerfile ready, just run the following command in the folder where your Dockerfile is located. The tool first tries to find `e2b.Dockerfile`, which should prevent with collisions with your main Dockerfile. If not found it fallbacks to `Dockerfile`.

```bash
e2b env build
```

This will build your environment, it will also create a `e2b.toml` file in the same folder, which will store the sandbox id.

If you want to keep your sandbox Dockerfile somewhere else, you can run  the `--dockerfile` flag.

The working directory will be the one where the CLI tool is executed. {{ className: 'red' }}

```bash
e2b env build --dockerfile /path/to/Dockerfile
```

### Dockerignore

If you want to ignore some files in your Docker build, you can create a `.dockerignore` file in the same folder as you are running the CLI from. If you don't want to use it, you can run the following command:

```bash
e2b env build --no-dockerignore
```

## Update your sandbox

If you want to update your sandbox, you can just run the same command as you did to build it. It will build a new image and update your sandbox. It will remember the dockerfile path

```bash
e2b env build
```
