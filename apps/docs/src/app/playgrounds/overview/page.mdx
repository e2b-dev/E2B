# AI Playgrounds

**AI Playground is a sandboxed cloud environment for your AI agent or AI app.**
The AI playground is like a free sandbox where your AI agent or app can safely operate with filesystem, use any tools, run code, access the internet, and more.
You can think about the playground as a small virtual machine for your AI.

Each active instance of your AI agent or app gets its own AI playground. You can create as many AI playgrounds as you want. AI playgrounds are created on-demand and are destroyed when not in use.

The AI playgrounds run on E2B's cloud infrastructure. Use our [SDK](/getting-started/installation) to create and control the AI playground.
