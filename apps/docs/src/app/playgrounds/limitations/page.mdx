### Customization
We're working on completely customizable playgrounds. In the meantime,
we currently offer playgrounds with following preinstalled binaires:
- Nodejs
- Bash
- Python3
- Java
- Go
- Rust
- PHP
- Perl
- DotNET

Each playground will have preinstalled binaries for the given runtime. So for example, the `Perl` playground will have preinstalled runtime to run `Perl` scripts, similarly `Python3` playground will have preinstalled runtime to run `Python3` scripts,
similarly `Go` playground will have preinstalled runtime to run `Go` scripts and so on.

However, you're free to install any other binaries, libraries, packagets, etc on your playground once you start it.
