# Basic Usage
Following code snippets should get you going fast with primitives in our SDK.
{/* For more real-life scenarios head to the [Examples section](./examples/overview). {{ className: 'lead' }} */}

There are two main primitives in our SDK that you use to interact with the cloud playground:
- [Filesystem](/getting-started/basics#filesystem)
- [Process](/getting-started/basics#process)

## Create AI Playground

<CodeGroupAutoload path="basics/init" />


## Get playground URL
Each playground is accessible from the internet via a unique URL of that playground.

<CodeGroupAutoload path="basics/get_url" />

### Get URL for a specific port inside playground
Below is an example showing how to get a URL for a port 3000. If there's any server inside the playground listening on port 3000 this would be its URL.

<CodeGroupAutoload path="basics/get_url_port" />

## Scan open ports inside playground
The following example continuously scan open ports inside the playground and prints new ones to the console.

<CodeGroupAutoload path="basics/scan_ports" /> 


## Filesystem

Here are the basic operations you can do with the filesystem inside a cloud playground:
- [List directory](/getting-started/basics#list-directory-content)
- [Create directory](/getting-started/basics#create-directory)
- [Write to file](/getting-started/basics#write-to-file)
- [Read file](/getting-started/basics#read-file)
- [Watch directory for changes](/getting-started/basics#watch-directory-for-changes)


## List directory content
<CodeGroupAutoload path="basics/fs_ls" />

## Create directory

A creation of a directory will fail if any directory on the path doesn't exist yet.
For example, if you want to create a directory `/home/user/new_dir` and `/home/user` doesn't exist yet, you will get an error.

<CodeGroupAutoload path="basics/fs_mkdir" />

## Write to file
When writing to a file that doesn't exist, it will get created.

When writing to a file that already exists, it will get overwritten.

When writing to a file that's in a directory that doesn't exist, you'll get an error.

<CodeGroupAutoload path="basics/fs_write" />

## Read file
<CodeGroupAutoload path="basics/fs_read" />

## Watch directory for changes
<CodeGroupAutoload path="basics/fs_watch" />


## Process
Here are the basic operations you can do with the process inside a cloud playground:
- [Start process](/getting-started/basics#start-process)
- [Stop process](/getting-started/basics#stop-process)
- [Stream stdout](/getting-started/basics#stream-stdout)
- [Send stdin](/getting-started/basics#send-stdin)
- [Stream stderr](/getting-started/basics#stream-stderr)

## Start process
<CodeGroupAutoload path="basics/process_start" />

## Stop process
<CodeGroupAutoload path="basics/process_stop" />

## Stream stdout
<CodeGroupAutoload path="basics/process_stream_stdout" />

## Send stdin
<CodeGroupAutoload path="basics/process_write_stdin" />

## Stream stderr
<CodeGroupAutoload path="basics/process_stream_stderr" />
