# Multiple Processes

The SDK supports starting multiple processes in the playground. You don't have to use any special parameters to enable this.

## Background Processes

If you want to start a long running process (for example a server) in the background you should use `session.process.start` to start the process but after that you should not `await` for the process to finish.

After you start this background process you can continue to use the SDK.

At any time you can kill the background process by calling the `kill()` method on the `Process` object and then retrieve the output of the process by accessing the `output` property of the `Process` object.
