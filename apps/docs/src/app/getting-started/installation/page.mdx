# Installation

We offer SDKs for **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **Python**. The SDKs are runnable both from backend environments (e.g.: servers) and frontend environments (e.g.: webapps).
You can install them using the following commands:

<CodeGroup>
```bash {{ language: 'js' }}
npm install @e2b/sdk
```
```bash {{ language: 'python' }}
pip install e2b
```
</CodeGroup>

Once installed head over to the [Basics](/getting-started/basics) section. {{ className: 'lead' }}
