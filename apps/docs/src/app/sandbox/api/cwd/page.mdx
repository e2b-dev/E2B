# Current Working Directory

You can set a working directory either for the whole sandbox, a filesystem operation, or a new process.

## Sandbox

If the current working directory for the sandbox is not set, it will default to the home directory - `/home/user`.

<CodeGroupAutoload path="cwd/sandbox" />

## Filesystem

All filesystem operations with relative paths are relative to the current working directory.

<CodeGroupAutoload path="cwd/filesystem"/>

## Process

If you set a working directory for the sandbox, all processes will inherit it. You can override it for each process.

<CodeGroupAutoload path="cwd/process"/>
