# Sandbox compute
Pro customers can customize the sandbox with **any combination** of the CPU and RAM based on the following tables.

Read a dedicated page to [learn more about pricing](/pricing).

<Note>
To customize your sandbox compute, you need to build your custom sandbox template using the CLI by running [`e2b template build`](http://localhost:3000/docs/cli/commands#template-build) and specifying the `--cpu-count` and `--memory-mb` options.
