# Sandbox URL
Each sandbox has its own URL that you can use to connect to any service running inside the sandbox.

For example, you can start a server inside the sandbox and connect to it from your browser.

<CodeGroupAutoload path="basics/get_url" isRunnable={true} />


If you want to get an URL for a specific port inside the sandbox, pass the port number to the `getHostname()`/`get_hostname()` method.
<CodeGroupAutoload path="basics/get_url_port" isRunnable={true} />
