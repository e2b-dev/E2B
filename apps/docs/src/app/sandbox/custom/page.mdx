# Customizing Sandbox
You can build your own custom sandbox by creating the [Sandbox Template](/sandbox/templates/overview).

Sandbox template is a Dockerfile that describes the environment of your sandbox.
Once you build your custom sandbox with the CLI, you can then use our SDK to spawn and control your new sandbox.

Checkout out [Sandbox Templates](/sandbox/templates/overview) if you want to create your own custom sandbox.
