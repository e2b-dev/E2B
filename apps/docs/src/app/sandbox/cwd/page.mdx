# Current Working Directory

You can set a working directory either for the whole session, a filesystem operation, or a new process.

## Session

If the current working directory for the session is not set, it will default to the home directory - `/home/user`.

<CodeGroupAutoload path="cwd/session" />

## Filesystem

All filesystem operations with relative paths are relative to the current working directory.

<CodeGroupAutoload path="cwd/filesystem"/>

## Process

If you set a working directory for the session, all processes will inherit it. You can override it for each process.

<CodeGroupAutoload path="cwd/process"/>
