# Pricing


E2B is currently in beta and free to use. {{ className: 'lead' }}

We're going to offer both free and premium tiers in the future. Pricing will be based on usage of our [cloud playgrounds](/playgrounds/overview) through the SDK.

Our goal is to offer a free tier for hobbyists and personal projects and a premium tier for companies or projects with high usage. Similarly to for example [Supabase](https://supabase.com/pricing) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/pricing).
