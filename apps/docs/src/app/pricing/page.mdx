## Sandbox compute
Pro customers can customize the sandbox with **any combination** of the CPU and RAM based on the following tables.

<Note>
To customize your sandbox compute, you need to build your custom sandbox template using the [E2B CLI](/cli/installation).
Run [`e2b template build`](/cli/commands#template-build) and specify the `--cpu-count` and `--memory-mb` options.
