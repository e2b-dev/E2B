# E2B Documentation
Here you'll find all the guides, concepts, and SDK reference for developing with E2B.

<CodeGroup isTerminalCommand>
```bash {{ language: 'js' }}
npm i @e2b/code-interpreter
```
```bash {{ language: 'python' }}
pip install e2b-code-interpreter
```
</CodeGroup>

## What is E2B?
E2B is an [open-source](https://github.com/e2b-dev) infrastructure that allows you run to AI-generated code in secure isolated sandboxes in the cloud.
To start and control sandboxes, use our [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/e2b/) or [JavaScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/e2b). {{ className: 'lead' }}

Some of the typical use cases for E2B are AI data analysis or visualization, running AI-generated code of various languages, playground for coding agents, environment for codegen evals, or running full AI-generated apps like in [Fragments](https://github.com/e2b-dev/fragments).

### Under the hood
The E2B Sandbox is a small isolated VM the can be started very quickly (~150ms). You can think of it as a small computer for the AI model. You can run many sandboxes at once. Typically, you run separate sandbox for each LLM, user, or AI agent session in your app.
For example, if you were building an AI data analysis chatbot, you would start the sandbox for every user session.
