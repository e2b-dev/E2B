# List sandboxes

You can list all sandboxes using the following command:

<CodeGroup isTerminalCommand>
```bash
e2b sandbox list
```
</CodeGroup>

This will return all sandboxes, both running and paused.

### Filter by state

To filter the sandboxes by their state you can specify the `--state` flag, which can either be "**running**", "**paused**" or both.

```bash
e2b sandbox list --state running,paused
```

### Filter by metadata

To filter the sandboxes by their metadata, use the `--metadata` flag.

```bash
e2b sandbox list --metadata key1=value1,key2=value2
```

### List limit

To limit the amount of sandboxes returned by the command, use the `--limit` flag.

```bash
e2b sandbox list --limit 10
```

By default, the command will return all sandboxes.
