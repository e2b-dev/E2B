## Sandbox metadata

You can assign metadata to your sandbox. This metadata will be available if you call `Sandbox.list()`. This can be useful in situation where each of your users have dedicated sandbox and the time between the steps of the integration is long. You can use the metadata to store the user id and reconnect to it later.
