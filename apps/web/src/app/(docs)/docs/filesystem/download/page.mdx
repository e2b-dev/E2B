# Download data from sandbox

You can download data from the sandbox using the `files.read()` method.

<CodeGroup>
```js
import fs from 'fs'
import { Sandbox } from '@e2b/code-interpreter'

const sandbox = await Sandbox.create()

// Read file from sandbox
const content = await sandbox.files.read('/path/in/sandbox')
// Write file to local filesystem
fs.writeFileSync('/local/path', content)
```
```python
from e2b_code_interpreter import Sandbox

sandbox = Sandbox()

# Read file from sandbox
content = sandbox.files.read('/path/in/sandbox')
# Write file to local filesystem
with open('/local/path', 'w') as file:
  file.write(content)
```
</CodeGroup>


## Download with pre-signed URL

Some times you may want to let users from unauthorized environment to download files from the sandbox, like a user's browser.
For this use-case you can use pre-signed URLs to and let download files securely.

<CodeGroup>
```js
import fs from 'fs'
import { Sandbox } from '@e2b/code-interpreter'

// Start secured sandbox (all operations must be authorized by default)
const sandbox = await Sandbox.create(template, { secure: true })

// Create a pre-signed URL for file download with 10 seconds expiration
const publicUrl = sbx.downloadUrl(
  'demo.txt', {
    useSignature: true,
    useSignatureExpiration: 10_000, // optionals
  },
)

// You can just visit the URL in browser to download the file
const res = await fetch(publicUrl)
const content = await res.text()

```
</CodeGroup>
