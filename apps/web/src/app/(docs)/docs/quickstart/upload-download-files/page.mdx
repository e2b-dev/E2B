# Upload & downloads files

E2B Sandbox allows you to upload and downloads file to and from the Sandbox.

An alternative way to get your data to the sandbox is to create a [custom sandbox template](/docs/sandbox-template).


## Upload file
<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ language: 'js' }}
import { Sandbox } from '@e2b/code-interpreter'

// Read local file relative to the current working directory
const content = fs.readFileSync('local/file')

const sbx = await Sandbox.create()
// Upload file to the sandbox to absolute path '/home/user/my-file'
await sbx.files.write('/home/user/my-file', content)
```

```python {{ language: 'python' }}
from e2b_code_interpreter import Sandbox

sbx = Sandbox()

# Read local file relative to the current working directory
with open("local/file", "rb") as file:
   # Upload file to the sandbox to absolute path '/home/user/my-file'
	sbx.files.write("/home/user/my-file", file)
```
</CodeGroup>


## Upload multiple files
Currently, if you want to upload multiple files, you need to upload each one of the separately.
We're working on a better solution.

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ language: 'js' }}
import { Sandbox } from '@e2b/code-interpreter'

// Read local file relative to the current working directory
const fileA = fs.readFileSync('local/file/a')
const fileB = fs.readFileSync('local/file/b')

const sbx = await Sandbox.create()
// Upload file A to the sandbox to absolute path '/home/user/my-file-a'
await sbx.files.write('/home/user/my-file-a', fileA)
// Upload file B to the sandbox to absolute path '/home/user/my-file-b'
await sbx.files.write('/home/user/my-file-b', fileB)
```

```python {{ language: 'python' }}
from e2b_code_interpreter import Sandbox

sbx = Sandbox()

# Read local file relative to the current working directory
with open("local/file/a", "rb") as file:
   # Upload file to the sandbox to absolute path '/home/user/my-file-a'
	sbx.files.write("/home/user/my-file-a", file)

with open("local/file/b", "rb") as file:
   # Upload file to the sandbox to absolute path '/home/user/my-file-b'
	sbx.files.write("/home/user/my-file-b", file)
```
</CodeGroup>


## Upload directory
We currently don't support an easy way to upload a whole directory.
You need to upload each file separately.

We're working on a better solution.

## Download file
To download a file, you need to first get the file's content and then write it to a local file.

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ language: 'js' }}
import { Sandbox } from '@e2b/code-interpreter'

const sbx = await Sandbox.create()
// Download file from the sandbox to absolute path '/home/user/my-file'
const content = await sbx.files.read('/home/user/my-file')
// Write file to local path relative to the current working directory
fs.writeFileSync('local/file', content)
```

```python {{ language: 'python' }}
from e2b_code_interpreter import Sandbox

sbx = Sandbox()
# Download file from the sandbox to absolute path '/home/user/my-file'
content = sbx.files.read('/home/user/my-file')
# Write file to local path relative to the current working directory
with open('local/file', 'w') as file:
    file.write(content)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Download multiple files
To download multiple files, you need to download each one of them separately from the sandbox.

We're working on a better solution.


<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ language: 'js' }}
import { Sandbox } from '@e2b/code-interpreter'

const sbx = await Sandbox.create()
// Download file A from the sandbox by absolute path '/home/user/my-file-a'
const contentA = await sbx.files.read('/home/user/my-file-a')
// Write file A to local path relative to the current working directory
fs.writeFileSync('local/file/a', contentA)

// Download file B from the sandbox by absolute path '/home/user/my-file-b'
const contentB = await sbx.files.read('/home/user/my-file-b')
// Write file B to local path relative to the current working directory
fs.writeFileSync('local/file/b', contentB)
```

```python {{ language: 'python' }}
from e2b_code_interpreter import Sandbox

sbx = Sandbox()
# Download file A from the sandbox by absolute path '/home/user/my-file-a'
contentA = sbx.files.read('/home/user/my-file-a')
# Write file A to local path relative to the current working directory
with open('local/file/a', 'w') as file:
    file.write(contentA)

# Download file B from the sandbox by absolute path '/home/user/my-file-b'
contentB = sbx.files.read('/home/user/my-file-b')
# Write file B to local path relative to the current working directory
with open('local/file/b', 'w') as file:
    file.write(contentB)
```
</CodeGroup>
