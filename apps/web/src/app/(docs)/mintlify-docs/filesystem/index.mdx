Each E2B Sandbox has its own isolated filesystem. The [Hobby tier](https://e2b.dev/pricing) sandboxes come with 1 GB of the free disk space and [Pro tier](https://e2b.dev/pricing) sandboxes come with 5 GB.

With E2B SDK you can:
- [Read and write files to the sandbox.](/filesystem/read-write)
- [Watch directory for changes.](/filesystem/watch)
- [Upload data to the sandbox.](/filesystem/upload)
- [Download data from the sandbox.](/filesystem/download)
