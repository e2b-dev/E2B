# Compute pricing
We charge per second of a running sandbox.
- vCPU: $0.000014 per second (~$0.05 per hour)
- GiB RAM: $0.0000045 per second (~$0.018 per hour)
- GiB storage: Free

<Note>
1 GiB is equal to 1,024 MiB
</Note>

## Sandbox compute
Pro customers can customize the sandbox with **any combination** of the CPU and RAM based on the following tables.

<Note>
<b>By default your sandbox has 2 vCPU and 512 MiB RAM.</b>

To customize your sandbox compute, you need to build your custom sandbox template using the [E2B CLI](/legacy/cli/installation).
Run [`e2b template build`](/legacy/cli/commands#template-build) and specify the `--cpu-count` and `--memory-mb` options.

For example this custom build gives your sandbox 8 vCPU and 4GiB of RAM
```sh
e2b template build --cpu-count 8 --memory-mb 4096
```
</Note>

[Let us know](/legacy/getting-help) if you need more powerful compute.
