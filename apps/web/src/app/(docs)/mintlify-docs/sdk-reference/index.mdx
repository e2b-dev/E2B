title: SDK Reference
---

This is the SDK reference for the [E2B CLI & Core SDK](https://github.com/e2b-dev/e2b), [Code Interpreter SDK](https://github.com/e2b-dev/code-interpreter), and [Desktop Sandbox SDK](https://github.com/e2b-dev/desktop).

The reference is intended to be limited to low-level descriptions of various programmatic functionality. If youâ€™re just getting started with E2B, we would instead recommend looking at the [documentation]() first or to get started quickly with an example.
