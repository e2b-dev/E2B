To use the API key, you can either:

- **Set the API key as the `E2B_API_KEY` environment variable** to avoid passing it each time you create a sandbox.
- Or pass it directly to the `Sandbox` constructor as shown below:

<CodeGroup>
```js JavaScript & TypeScript
import { Sandbox } from '@e2b/code-interpreter'

const sandbox = await Sandbox.create({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' })
```
```python Python
from e2b_code_interpreter import Sandbox

sbx = Sandbox.create(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
```
</CodeGroup>

## Where to find API key

You can get your API key at [dashboard](https://e2b.dev/dashboard?tab=keys).

# Access Token

The access token is used only in the CLI and is **not needed in the SDK**. There's no need to set it when logging into the CLI using `e2b auth login`.

<Note>
To authenticate without the browser, you can set `E2B_ACCESS_TOKEN` as an environment variable. This is useful for CI/CD pipelines.
