[e2b](https://e2b.dev) or etob (*english2bits*) allows you to create & deploy virtual software developers. These virtual developers are powered by specialized AI agents that build software based on your instructions and can use tools.

Agents operate in our own secure sandboxed cloud environments that's powered by [Firecracker](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/).

e2b currently supports building only REST servers in Node.js. Specifically using the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework. We'll support more use-cases with time.

# 🚀 Get started
We're working on the cloud-hosted version. In the meantime, the fastest way try out e2b is to run it locally via Docker.

## 🐳 Start e2b with Docker
You will need:
- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) (support for more and custom models coming soon)
- Docker
- Node.js *16+*
- Free ports 3000 (Next.js app), 54321 (Supabase API Gateway), 54322 (Supabase Database)

To start e2b run:
```
npm start
```

Then open page on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

`npm start` starts local Supabase in the background - to stop it you have to run `npm run stop`.

## 💻 Development setup
For developing with hot reloading and contributing to the project you may want to run the app locally without Docker (`npm start` command).

[Follow these steps](DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md) to set it up.

# Features
## 🛠 Bring your own X
While e2b will offer the "batteries-included" solution, our goal is to let users:
- **BYOM** - Bring Your Own Model
- **BYOP** - Bring Your Own Prompt
- **BYOT** - Bring Your Own Tools

## 🤖 Supported models and model hosting providers
